<h2>11. Priests and blessings</h2>

11.1 An ordained priest can ask for the Lord's blessing. The priest must specify his purpose: do they ask for the Lord's blessing to aid in their scourging of the undead, or for personal gain?

11.2 The prayers and rituals take about 30 minutes to complete, and the blessing lasts until one sunrise and one sunset has passed (in either order).

11.2.1 There may also be other situations where the Lord blesses some person, item, place or activity.

11.3 Asking for the Lord's blessing for a selfish or ungodly purpose, regardless of whether it is given, gives the priest one point of penance. Each point of penance counts as as point of fatigue for the purposes of hit point rolls.

11.4 Asking for the Lord's blessing for a just and good purpose, and then taking actions to fulfil that purpose, removes one point of penance.

11.5 When subject to the Lord's blessing, a character gets +1 to all checks and saves made in the course of pursuing the original purpose.

11.5.2 If the purpose of the blessing is surviving a certain danger ("the Lord's protection"), the +1 bonus is applied to AC, defense rolls, injury saves and other completely passive saves. Such a blessing fades once the danger has passed.

11.6 Undead creatures and demons are repelled by the Lord's blessing, and it is extra effective. The degree of this effect is determined by the level of the priest and the rank (HD) of the monster as per below. (The table is cumulative, so each row adds an additional effect.)
