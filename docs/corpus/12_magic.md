<h2>12. Magic</h2>

12.1 In addition to any other magic-related skills, each spell that characters could conceivably learn and cast is represented as a skill of its own. Naturally, almost all characters have a 0% skill rating for all spells.

12.2 A character who knows a spell can cast it as a ritual. This takes 1 hour per spell level, requires some amount of ritual components or implements, and succeeding two skill checks: one for knowledge, on for will, both modified by the skill rating, both against DC 20.

12.3 A character with _Goetia_ (or some other similar initiation) can prepare spells. This takes 2 hours, and lets them memorise spells for easy casting. Casting a prepared spell is quick, and only requires a d100 roll under the spell skill rating—meaning a spell known at 100% succeeds automatically.

12.4 Preparing spells a second time in the same day gives one point of fatigue, similar to taking a short rest.

12.5 A character can only prepare as many spells as their level. Furthermore, these "spell slots" are also limited to one at each spell level (or lower). (E.g. a 4th-level Sage could prepare one spell each of levels 1, 2, 3 and 4; they could also choose to instead prepare four spells of levels 1, 2, 2 and 4.)

12.6 The same spell can be prepared multiple times (taking up multiple spell slots).

12.7 In order to prepare spells or cast them as rituals, a character needs access to their spell book, or equivalent. This is taken to be their complete works on their understanding of magic.

12.8 A character with a spell book of their own can research one new spell every time they gain a level, as well as every time they make a find enabling a breakthrough. The typical magical find is the spell book of a magician from another culture, another time, or another school of magic. The specific subject of their research determines which spell they learn.

12.9 Spell research takes 4d6 days per spell level, and takes up their time to the extent that they cannot do meaningful work in the meantime. If they need to attend to their own shopping, cooking, laundry etc the time requirement is doubled. This basic time requirement gives the character a skill rating of 50% in the new spell.

12.10 A character with _Goetia_ (or some similar initiation) can choose to do basic exploratory research; they then learn a new random 1st-level spell.

12.11 A character with an initiation for a specific magic school can focus their research there; they then learn the next spell in that school's curriculum when they gain a level.

12.12 A character who has access to the writings of another magician can focus their research there; they then learn one of that magician's spells (that they did not already know), determined at random.

12.13 A character who has access to a mentor in the magic arts can do research under their tutelage; they then learn a specific spell of the mentor's choosing, at half the mentor's own skill rating. This consumes the mentor's time as well as the student's.

12.14 Focused academic study of a spell gives 1d6 points of skill improvement per full day spent.

12.15 A character who tried to cast at least one spell during a session gets an extra improvement roll at the end of the session. This roll is not for abilities; instead they can try to improve one spell skill rating. The player rolls a d100: if the result is higher than their current rating, they get the result as their new rating; if it is lower, they improve it by 1d6 points instead.
