<h2>12. Magic</h2>

<details><summary markdown="span">Click for history and notes</summary>
These rules were changed extensively two adventures into Dungeon Crawl '22, following a discussion of the new rules in the campaign's discord. The problems that the changes attempted to address were: 1) Initiations strictly limited who could even learn which spells, 2) Ritual magic did not have much use, 3) It felt unrealistically hard to learn each others' spells and 4) Both rituals and spell preparation took too long time. Some of the changes, mostly to 1), also brought us back closer in line to Eero's original rules.

12.1 In addition to any other magic-related skills, each spell that characters could conceivably learn and cast is represented as a skill of its own. Naturally, almost all characters have a 0% skill rating for all spells.

12.2 A character who knows a spell can cast it as a ritual. This takes 30 minutes, requires some amount of ritual components or implements, and succeeding two skill checks: one for knowledge, one for will, both modified by the skill rating, both against DC 20 plus the level differential (e.g. a 1st-level character casting a 3rd-level spell uses DC 22).

12.2.1 The requirements for a ritual may differ between spells and between characters, but most spells have both verbal components and some physical component, whether movements or items. If the caster has access to their spellbook, can speak, and is not physically restrained they are typically able to perform a ritual.

12.3 A character with _Goetia_ (or some other similar initiation) can _prepare_ some of their spell spells. This takes 1 hour, and lets them memorise spells for easy casting. Casting a prepared spell is quick, and only requires a d100 roll under the spell skill rating—meaning a spell known at 100% succeeds automatically. If the check is failed the spell stays in memory and can be attempted again within a minute.

12.4 Preparing spells a second time in the same day gives one point of fatigue, similar to taking a short rest.

A character ought to be able to count the spell preparation as a short rest, re-rolling their HP; this would yield a total of two fatigue points.

12.5 A character can only prepare as many spells as their level. Furthermore, these "spell slots" are also limited to one at each spell level (or lower). (E.g. a 4th-level Sage could prepare one spell each of levels 1, 2, 3 and 4; they could also choose to instead prepare four spells of levels 1, 2, 2 and 4.)

12.6 The same spell can be prepared multiple times (taking up multiple spell slots).

12.7 In order to prepare spells, a character needs access to their spell book, or equivalent. This is taken to be their complete works on their understanding of magic.

12.8 "Study of magic" is a skill. Unless otherwise stated, Fighters have 0–10%, Adventurers have 0–30% and Sages have 20–40%; ordained priests typically have no higher than 20% to reflect that they have been taught to view arcane arts as ungodly.

12.9. If a character has a skill bonus for a certain type of magic studies, they add it to their base value in those situations. E.g. a Pyromancer with Study of magic 40% and Study pyromancy +100% uses 140% when studying fire-related spells.

12.10 A character who studies magic somehow – perhaps studying an artifact, reading spellbooks or under a teacher – can roll d100 under their _Study of magic_ value to learn a new spell. If the roll is successful, they can learn a new spell after 4d6 days of study. If the roll is below 1/10th of their value, they learn it after only 1 day of study.

12.10.1 Normally, the character learns a spell or other magic skill based on their object of study, if possible – for example a random spell contained in the spellbook or known to their master. If there is at least spell possible to learn which is at most at the student's own level, they can choose to focuse their studies on only those spells.

12.10.2 Some initiations allow characters to instead use their magic studies to develop their own spells, seemingly unrelated to the exact nature of their object of study.

Speculative: the option to learn a spell from the object of study may be unavailable, for example when studying a spellbook all of whose spells you know, or studying a magic artifact whose ability cannot realistically be made into a spell. It seems to me that in the first case you have nothing to learn and further study gives no gains; in the second case you can still use it to further your own spell research.

12.10.3 A character can only learn a new spell from the study of the same source of knowledge once per level.

12.11 After gaining a level, a character can expand their own understanding of magic even without an external source of magic knowledge: they gain an extra opportunity for spell research within the fields of their magic initiations.

12.12 A new spell is learnt at a skill rating of 50% - (10% * skill differential), or half the skill level of the teacher, which ever is lower.

12.13 Focused academic study of a spell gives 1d6 points of skill improvement per full day spent.

12.14 All spell research and study takes up the researcher's time to the extent that they cannot do meaningful work in the meantime. If they need to attend to their own shopping, cooking, laundry etc the time requirement is doubled.

During Dungeon Crawl '22, we worked from the price lists in LotFP and found the following options for lodging during spell research:
1. Stay at an inn (rural), 5 sp / day
2. Stay at an inn (city), 10 sp / day
3. Rent a countryside cottage (double research time), 40 sp / month
4. Rent a countryside cottage and hire a servant, 106 sp / month
5. Rent an apt. in the city (double research time), 75 sp / month
6. Rent an apt. in the city and hire a servant, 131 sp / month

12.15 A character who tried to cast at least one spell during a session gets an extra improvement roll at the end of the session. This roll is not for abilities; instead they can try to improve the skill rating of one spell they attempted. The player rolls a d100: if the result is higher than their current rating, they get the result as their new rating; if it is lower, they improve it by 1d6 points instead.
