<h2>13. Exploration and travel</h2>

13.1 One _exploration turn_ is 10 minutes long; this unit is defined purely for convenient reference. A typical result of a successful ability check in exploration, e.g. searching for hidden doors, is that the task succeeds in a set number of turns, while allowing for extra degrees of success to reduce the number of turns taken.

13.2 A burning torch lasts for 6 turns and a small candle for 18 turns. A lantern will hold oil lasting 8 hours (48 turns), and a small flask of oil can fill it twice i.e. give 16 hours of light.

The original rule for lamps was 24 turns i.e. 3 hours, but this was changed early on in Dungeon Crawl '22 after looking up realistic burning durations of lantern oil. The current rule may even be something of a compromise with gamist concerns (i.e. real lantern oil may last even longer).

13.3 The referee tracks the in-game time, and the characters do not necessarily know the exact time of day (especially not when exploring underground). The referee will make judgment calls on how long time exploration, mapping, discussions and similar tasks take.

A common baseline is that one interaction (searching a room, one attempt to pick a lock or break down a door) takes one or two turns.

13.4 An unencumbered character travels at a base rate of 24 miles per day over country roads. Travelling off-road over plains, or following trails through what is otherwise wilderness, reduces this to 18 miles. Travelling over deserts, hills or through forests brings it down to 12 miles, and through jungles, mountains or swamps an unencumbered character only marks 8 miles per day.

13.4 Rain, snow or high winds reduce distance travelled to 1/2 the going rate, and full-on storm conditions reduce it to 1/3.

13.5 Depending on the locale, the referee will roll encounter checks with a given frequency and probability. The typical setup for overland travel is 1/3 probability of an encounter, rolled once per day plus once per 6 miles travelled. The typical setup for dungeon exploration is 1/6 probability, rolled either once per hour (quieter dungeons) or once per turn (more active dungeons).

13.6 Hunting animals for food in the wilderness requires a strength check and a ranged weapon, or alternatively a knowledge check if traps are used, modified by the hunting skill, against DC 20.

13.7 On plains the hunting DC is decreased by 5, and in jungles and forests the DC is decreased by 10. In the winter the DC is increased by 5 everywhere except in deserts, where the DC is increased by 5 regardless of season.

13.8 A successful roll means that 1d4 rations'  worth of food has been laid down. Successful ranged hunting lessens the distance travelled that day by 1d4*25% (multiple hunters each roll and use the worst result among them); unsuccessful hunting takes all day. Hunting with traps takes all day regardless of outcome. Each extra success can be used to find 1 extra ration, or to give an advantage die to the distance reduction roll. 

13.9 Foraging for edible plants and mushrooms is resolved the same way as hunting, with these modifications: the distance travelled is the same as for ranged hunting, but knowledge is used, no particular equipment is required, and the DC is increased by 5.

13.10 Water is easy to come by in most settings. If the characters come across water at least once a day, and have the carrying capacity of one ration per person, there's no need to track the drinking and refilling closely.
