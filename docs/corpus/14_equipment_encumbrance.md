<h2>14. Equipment and encumbrance</h2>

14.1 Players should write down what their characters are carrying, and preferably where each item is carried.

14.2 The referee can call for an encumbrance audit at any time. If any characters are found to be carrying much more than they should be able to, some of their gear is retroactively found to have been left behind. Which things are kept is decided by the group as a whole, making an honest attempt at figuring out which things the party would have prioritised when they left some things behind.

14.3 For purposes of encumbrance, equipment is measured in _stones_. A stone is technically an old unit of weight, equal to 14 lb or about 6.3 kg. In this game, that value is used as a guideline, but 1 stone is also a more abstract measure of how encumbered a character is by their equipment. Sometimes it matters more whether the stuff can be strapped to a backpack, for instance, than its exact weight. The guidelines for stones can be bartered around somewhat.

These encumbrance rules (14.3 through 14.13) are directly lifted from this character sheet, intended for use with DnD 5e, by Sandra "2097": https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ly-2ps0cPdMCumpp7apOh8aIneWcuwc_/view?usp=sharing (The link is a re-host; I believe the original is available somewhere at Sandra's page idiomdrottning.org but I have lost the link.)

14.4 Clothes and light armour count as 0 stones when worn. A chainmail shirt is 1 stone, full chainmail armour 3 stone, and full plate armour 4 stone.

14.5 A backpack is worth 1 stone when filled with up to 15 small things, 2 stone when filled with up to 30.

14.6 One ration of food counts as 2 small things.

14.7 Holding or wearing a few medium-sized item, such as a sword and a small shield, counts for 1 stone. Holding or wearing more than three counts for 1 stone more, and holding or wearing more than 6 in this fashion is practically impossible.

14.8 Big things can be carried by strapping them outside the backpack. This counts for stones as follows: 1 big thing: 1 stone; 2–3 big things: 2 stones, 4–5 big things: 3 stones.

14.9 Some examples of a small-sized items in a pack: a small book or scroll, a bundle of candles, an item of clothing, a torch, an object weighing about 1 lb.

14.10 Some examples of medium-sized items: a bow and a quiver, a sword, a bundle of torches, a hammer and a crowbar, a pouch holding up to 5 small things, an object weighing about 5 lb. 

14.11 Some examples of big things: a bedroll, a small light tent, 50' of rope, a 1-gallon waterskin (2 rations of water), an object weighing about 9 lb.

14.12 Large and heavy weapons like greatclubs, heavy crossbows and pikes can be strapped onto a backpack as big things, but if carried at the side, ready to use, they count for 1 stone by themselves.

14.13 A small purse with 50 coins (or other tiny things, like gemstones) can be kept in a backpack as a small thing, and a larger pouch of up to 250 coins can be worn on one's person as a medium thing.

14.13 The encumbrance level limits a character's athletic abilities. A character can carry their strength score / 3 (rounded to the nearest integer) in stones without being affected. Carrying more than that, they are encumbered: they travel overland at 2/3 of their usual speed, they take a disadvantage die to some athletic checks, and are outright unable to do others. This holds true for carrying up to the character's strength score x 2/3. If they carry one more stone than this, they cannot move faster than walking, they travel overland at 1/3 of their usual speed, and cannot perform almost any athletic tasks. Carrying even more than this is virtually impossible, but a character can drag a number of stones equal to their strength minus the amount they are carrying.

14.14 If the price of something is not apparent to the group or the referee given the setting, the price lists in _[Lamentations of the Flame Princess](https://paulgorman.org/roleplaying/dnd/misc/LotFP_Rules_and_Magic_Free_Version_without_Art.pdf)_ work well.

Maastricht '18 used the LotFP price lists.

14.15 The general classes of armour are leather/hide (0 stones, AC 22, 25sp), half-chain (1 stone, 24 AC, 50sp, ), full chain (3 stone, 26 AC, 100sp), half-plate (2 stone, 28 AC, 500sp) and full plate (4 stone, 30 AC, 1000sp).

Prices are based on those from _[Lamentations of the Flame Princess](https://paulgorman.org/roleplaying/dnd/misc/LotFP_Rules_and_Magic_Free_Version_without_Art.pdf)_. In Maastricht '18 we had the encumbrance values of full chain and half-plate switched around, but some players remarked that while chainmail is effectively carried on one's shoulders, plate mail is strapped on in a way that distributes the load.
