<h2>1. Point of play</h2>

1.1 The request we make of players: identify challenging opportunities and apply your wits and skills to achieve as much as you can, given the character you play.

1.2 If a character is no longer interested in adventuring, they should retire and the player should play another character. Retirement need not be forever—perhaps the character is interested in another adventure in the future.

1.2 The request we make of the referee: bring challenging content to the table, and facilitate our engagement with it.

1.3 Establish the particulars of a situation to help the players decide what to do and what to play. Share information about a mission before the PCs sign up for it.

1.4 Opting out can be a strategic choice for the players. Opting out of all adventures forever means the character is not involved in play anymore, but opting out of a particular adventure just means the risk/reward proposition was not good enough. The ref should bring multiple options to a given session.

1.5 The referee can lead the negotiation of what should be played, in particular by proposing trade-offs that quickly establish a situation everyone is interested in. Example: skipping over the details of supplying an expedition, and instead having the characters pay an eyeballed flat rate and starting the session just outside the expedition's goal.
