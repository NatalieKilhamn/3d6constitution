<h2>1. Point of play</h2>

1.1 The request we make of players: identify challenging opportunities and apply your wits and skills to achieve as much as you can, given the character you play.

1.2 If a character is no longer interested in adventuring, they should retire and the player should play another character. Retirement need not be foreverâ€”perhaps the character is interested in another adventure in the future.

1.2 The request we make of the referee: bring challenging content to the table, and facilitate our engagement with it.

1.3 Establish the particulars of a situation to help the players decide what to do and what to play. Share information about a mission before the PCs sign up for it.

From [Eero Tuovinen as summarized by David Berg](https://rickard80.github.io/storygames/?19234):
> * Establish the particulars of a situation before taking action (ref should both volunteer info and answer questions). Examples:
>   * share info about a mission before the PCs sign up for it
>   * share info about a dangerous room before the PCs enter it
>   * share info about a monster before the PCs enter combat with it

1.4 Opting out can be a strategic choice for the players. Opting out of all adventures forever means the character is not involved in play anymore, but opting out of a particular adventure just means the risk/reward proposition was not good enough. The ref should bring multiple options to a given session.

> * Opt out as a strategic choice.
>   * Players should not adopt poor risk/reward propositions "because they're there". A better option is never far off

1.5 The referee can lead the negotiation of what should be played, in particular by proposing trade-offs that quickly establish a situation everyone is interested in. Example: skipping over the details of supplying an expedition, and instead having the characters pay an eyeballed flat rate and starting the session just outside the expedition's goal.
