<h2>3. Die rolls and resolution</h2>

3.1 We resolve tasks by rolling 1d20+ability score, comparing the result to a difficulty class (DC); a result equal to or higher than the DC is considered a success. This roll is called an ability check; any ability check that resolves how a character passively deals with a situation forced upon them is called a "save".

3.2. If an ability check beats the DC by 5 points or more, we consider this a second degree of success. Each increment of 5 gives yet another degree of success. Conversely, when failing a check each full 5 points below the DC is considered another degree of failure. The interpretation of extra degrees of success and failure varies from case to case.

3.3 If a 20 is rolled on the d20 (before the ability score or any other modifications), another d20 is rolled and added to the result. If the second d20 rolls a 20, repeat.

3.5 If a 1 is rolled on the (first) d20, one degree of failure is added regardless of what the result would be otherwise. If there is no other interpretation, this failure might be ignored, or it might instead be scored as a -5 to the roll (effectively replacing the result of '1' by '-4').

3.6 A DC of 20 is considered "normal" difficulty, used for things that a normal adult human could definitely do, but might not succeed at every time. Easier tasks have lower DCs, more difficult tasks higher.

3.7 The DC of a task should be the same for different characters across different times. Differences in preconditions are preferably modelled as a bonus or penalty to the check, like for example a -2 because of injury or fatigue.

3.8 When a character has a large advantage they can roll an advantage die; this is done by rolling an extra die (of the same size, so an extra d20 for regular ability checks) and discounting the worse result. Similarly, a disadvantage die means rolling an extra die and discounting the better result.
