<h2>4. Characters</h2>

4.1 The main ability scores used are i) _strength_, a generic measure of physical competence, ii) _wits_, a measure of quick-thinking and alertness, iii) _knowledge_, a measure of lore and skill, iv) _will_, a measure of mental fortitude and being in tune with oneself, and v) _charisma_, a measure of social intelligence.

4.2 Each attribute is determined by rolling 3d6 when the character is created. A score of 10 indicates an average adult human.

4.3 Player characters can have a character class, granting special abilities outside of the ability scores. Characters also have a level, which usually starts at 1 and increases as they gain enough experience points, conferring various upgrades.

4.4 Each character can have a number of special abilities, known as _initiations_, equal to their level. Some initiations are exclusive to a certain character class, others are available to all characters. The lists of initiations are neither final nor exhaustive; new ones can and should be created for new characters.

4.5 A player character can have other properties or abilities, not covered by their class, if this is accepted by the referee (primarily) and the group (secondarily).

4.6 Some properties of a character are mainly determined by their fictional background; to the extent that this background is left unspecified, those properties might be as well.

4.7 The three basic character classes are i) _fighters_, who excel at combat; ii) _sages_, who excel in knowledge, and iii) _adventurers_, who are more flexible and might specialise in other fields.

4.8 A new character must be i) human, ii) from the "civilised world" or Gaul, and iii) relatively short on money. Any player who wishes to create a character different from this must have their concept accepted by the referee. Any player who wishes to use a non-standard character concept that has already been used once may only do so on a roll of 1 on a d6.

4.9 A player who participates in a session is rewarded with an opportunity to slightly improve a character they played in that session. This is done by rolling a d20 against any ability; on a roll higher than the ability score, the ability is raised by one point. On a lower roll, the player may try again against another ability. They only get to try to improve each ability once; if all fail, no such improvement happens that session.

4.10 A character has certain skills, rated from 0 to 100, where 0 means practically unaware of the skill and 100 means as well-versed as a regular human can get. Some ability checks are modified by the skill value, meaning the ability score is multiplied by the skill value interpreted as a percentage.

4.11 A character's skills are not recorded exhaustively. When a skill is used for the first time, the group considers the character's background and determine a reasonable skill level for them. Skills can go up and down according to the group's shared view of the character.
