<h2>5. Combat</h2>

5.1 At the start of the combat, each combatant rolls 1d20+wits for their initiative score. Each round, each character gets to act in order from highest initiative to lowest. Initiative scores carry over to the next round, and the combat rounds continue until combat ends. In the fiction, all action is considered to occur roughly simultaneously, so having your turn before another player represents literal initiative, and efficacy.

5.2. In addition to the one action allowed at their initiative count, a character can use their initiative score for extra actions or reactions.

5.3 The character who starts the round with the highest initiative can take -10 to their score after their turn; then they get to take another turn at their new value.

This is known as "superior initiative".

5.4 A character can take an initiative penalty to declare a reaction to another action.  The more natural the reaction, the smaller the penalty. Some examples: take -2 initiative to defend with a shield, shout a warning, or draw a weapon; take -5 to order subordinates to attack, attack an enemy who lets their guard down, or defend with a shield after the attack roll has been made; take -10 to make a riposte (for a character trained in such) or attack on a clear order when fighting inside an established chain of command.

In the Overgrown Cathedral, SPORK paid -2 initiative to roll a wits check to see if any more enemies were approaching. If this were done between rounds, it would have been free (see 5.5)

5.5 At the end of the round, the current bout of mêlée ends, with all combatants disengaging: circling each other, catching their breath, surveying the other side. Characters can perform actions that fit within the brief respite: knowledge checks, talking, perhaps even producing items from their packs or drinking potions. Physical actions taken between rounds generally cost initiative points. The next round starts as soon as either side demands it.

5.6 A character can try to re-orient themselves instead of taking any action, re-rolling their initiative. The new value is used if it is higher than the character's current initiative.
<details><summary markdown="span">Click for history and notes</summary>

Originally, the rule was that re-orienting was done between rounds, but the character could not take an action the following round (only reactions). In Maastricht '18, for whatever reason, we played with the current version anyway. It seems more intuitive that if you re-orient instead of taking your action, you make the choice that "costs your action" on that action, not beforehand. Also, with the old reading a character starting a fight at 0 due to surprise would always miss 2 whole rounds.

5.7 Casting a memorised spell must be declared between rounds, and is considered to take effect on the character’s own turn in the new round. Other characters can notice that the magician is trying to cast a spell from the start of the round, if for example they want to interrupt the casting.

5.8 If one side is unable or unwilling to withdraw from the bout, for example keeping their enemy locked in wrestling, they can force the bout to continue. Everyone involved takes -10 to their initiative score, and possible loses some HP, and start a new round immediately. They are not able to take any of the usual between-rounds actions. If all combatants drop to 0 initiative, the bout ends with the combatants forcibly separating as their bodies give away, or retreating under the power of pure instinct.

5.9 If a character’s initiative drops to 0, they are disoriented or flat-footed; they're uncertain about the quick events and momentarily distracted. This is a dangerous state: it allows opportunity attacks against the character (as if they dropped their guard) and disallows reactions. It also gives a penalty die to re-orienting rolls.

5.10 When some of the characters have the advantage of surprise, the initial initiative can be skewed to represent this. A prepared attacker triggering their ambush at the opportune moment might get an advantage die to their initiative, or forgo the roll and use their wits+20. Conversely, completely flat-footed victims might get a penalty die or even have their initiative set to 0, which means that their first round is most likely lost to re-orienting.

5.11 Henchmen and other NPC lackeys don’t roll an initiative of their own; instead, they always have an initiative score of 1. However, if they are part of a clear chain of command, they can be ordered to act by a superior: they will then act at the initiative value of the command instead of their own. If a character with a “proper” initiative roll follows a command, they do it in addition to their regular action, but in return pay initiative points like an ordinary reaction.

<details><summary markdown="span">Click for history and notes</summary>
It would seem to follow from this that such henchmen and NPC lackeys cannot take other reactions, such as defending with a shield. If this is true, perhaps they should get e.g. a +2 to AC from using a shield instead.

5.12 Monsters and NPC have a morale score ranging from 2–12. The following guidelines are used to figure out morale scores:
 * 2: traitorous, pressured into service, forced into service but no risk of enforcement
 * 3-4: cowardly, forced into service and enforcer close
 * 5-6: fickle, underpaid, hunting for sport
 * 7-9: normal pay, protecting territory or superiors, hunting for food
 * 8-9: good pay, protecting home or friends, hunting for food while starving
 * 10-11: well paid and emotionally invested, protecting own life or way of life
 * 12: mindless, zealous, parent protecting young

5.13 Monsters and NPCs may flee or give up based on a morale check. This check is made with 2d6, and a result equal to or under their morale score means they do not break. Morale checks are made when they are:
 * Surprised, but only on the first round after surprise
 * Faced by an obviously superior force
 * Aware an ally is slain by magic
 * Aware 25% of their group has fallen
 * Aware 50% of their group has fallen
 * Aware another companion is slain after more than 50% of the group has fallen
 * Aware their leader deserts or is slain
 * Fighting a creature they cannot harm due to magical protections
 * Ordered to attempt a heroically dangerous task
 * Offered temptation (bribe, chance to steal, etc.)
 * Told to act as a rear guard, such as covering a fighting withdrawal
 * Directed to use up or use a charge from a personal powerful magical item
 * Completely surrounded
 * Given a chance to surrender (and have met the conditions for one other morale check)

5.14 Regular attacks—both mêlée and ranged—are resolved through strength checks; the DC of an attack roll is the _armour class_ (AC) of the target.

5.15 The AC of an unarmoured but unconstrained human is 20. Most creatures take -5 if they are blind, -5 if they are constrained, -10 if they are unawares; they gain a bonus of +2 for light armour up to +10 for heavy armour.

5.16 Characters who are fighting an opponent with shorter reach, for example because of a smaller weapon, gain +1 AC against that opponent.

5.17 A character defending themselves actively makes a strength check and uses the result instead of their AC if it is higher. A character who uses their main combat action to actively defend themselves keeps an improved AC for the remainder of the round. A character who defends themselves as a reaction—which requires either a shield or some special training—only uses it for the one attack.

5.18 When an attack roll against a character succeeds, the attacker rolls their damage and the defender subtracts it from their current HP, if they have any. A regular armed attack from a human deals d6 damage. Merely falling to exactly zero HP does nothing in these rules, except leaving you open to injury from later attacks.

5.19 Extra degrees of success on attack rolls can be used to achieve extra effects, such as driving an enemy backwards.
<details><summary markdown="span">Click for history and notes</summary>

The specific effect of driving one's foe back was used extensively in the fight against the giant pelicans in the [Sky-Blind Spire](http://blog.trilemma.com/2016/04/the-sky-blind-spire.html). One extra success let the character drive a pelican slightly backwards; two successes were required to drive them out a window. Once outside, only one pelican could attack in through the window, forcing another to hover behind it without acting, while two humans could attack the one sticking its head in.

In the Overgrown Cathedral, a dire monkey was fighting Scout and Anka attacked it, scoring an extra success. This drove the monkey back just enough that Anka could position themselves between the monkey and Scout—the monkey would have had to maneauver somehow to keep attacking Scout.

5.20 Four extra degrees of success on an attack roll (i.e. beating the AC by 20) can be used to score a direct hit, bypassing the opponents hit points.

5.21 When making a ranged attack against a target who is in mêlée with another character, there is a risk that the attack hits the wrong target. If the characters have a clear facing—for example one of them is defending an exit, keeping it behind them—then firing from straight behind one of them has a 1/10 chance of hitting the one further away and a 9/10 chance of hitting the one closer. When firing into the same situation from the side, there is a 6/10 chance of hitting one's chosen target. By spending a full round aiming, the probability of hitting one's chosen target is increased a maximum of 2/10. Note that combatants in mêlée break apart at the end of each combat round, and only re-engage when either of them uses their turn.

In the Overgrown Cathedral, firing into mêlée from straight overhead was judged to be the same as shooting from the side. (Both were wrongly given as 5/10, corrected afterwards.)

5.22 When making a successful ranged attack, the player can choose to simply describe their action as taking aim. The attack reduces HP as usual. If and when that enemy makes an injury save, due to that attack roll or something else later, the referee can decide that the shooter has taken their shot.

Adapted from these [aiming rules]([https://idiomdrottning.org/arrow_threat/](https://idiomdrottning.org/aiming)) by Sandra "2097".
  
Note three sessions into Dungeon Crawl '22: this rule has never been used. In my opinion (Natalie), the fact that HP loss is not injuries already means that any attack is sort of abstract, and adding yet another layer where a ranged attack roll isn't even a clear attempt at an attack might make fighting _too_ abstract. Sandra's rules were also made for the 6-second combat rounds of DnD 5E; in this game's 1-minute combat round making a ranged attack already involves a lot of aiming. I believe it was a mistake to include this rule and think it should be removed.
