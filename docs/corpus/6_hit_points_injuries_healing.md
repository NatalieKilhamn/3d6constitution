<h2>6. Hit points, injuries and healing</h2>

6.1 A character usually has a set number of _hit dice_ (HD): having X HD means ones hit point total after a rest is Xd6.

6.2 Player characters have 1 HD per level.

6.3 HP can be made to represent guard, awareness, fatigue, fighting-spirit, divine protection—any, all or none of these things. How to describe hit point loss is up to each player, but unless a character is actually injured, which usually requires running out of HP, the descriptions shouldn't include anything more than very light bruises and scratches.

6.4 A character's hit points are re-rolled when they take a short rest. For the player characters, just ten minutes in a relatively safe spot is enough to qualify. When re-rolling, the new value is used even if it is lower than the character's previous total.

6.5 Each short rest taken gives the character one point of fatigue. Each point of fatigue makes the character roll one advantage die on their hit point re-roll. For example, a character with 2d6 HP taking their third short rest has two fatigue points already, and thus rolls 4d6, dropping the two highest results; then they gain a third fatigue point. Getting a good night's sleep resets the fatigue counter, and the character re-rolls their HP without disadvantage dice in the morning.

6.6 When a character is hurt and is not protected by hit points, they will be injured. They must roll two injury saves: a strength save to determine the severity and a will save to determine whether they are still standing. For regular attacks, the DC of both saves is 20 plus the amount of damage "overflow" when their hit points ran out.

6.7 Passing the strength injury save gives the character a minor wound. Failing means the character either dies outright, or they get a major wound—player's choice.

6.8 Passing the will injury save means the character keeps it together enough to keep fighting for now; failing means they collapse or pass out due to pain and fatigue. The player can choose to fail this save intentionally if they have no interest in staying in the fight.

6.9 Minor wounds (as well as major wounds) can vary a lot, and the particulars are generally decided by referee based on what caused the injury. They have to be real injuries (as opposed to the superficial descriptions that accompany HP loss) but the character should generally remain upright and combat capable at least after a short rest, if not right away. The default go-to minor wound is a shallow cut which gives a -2 to heavy physical tasks until the next long rest, and which might grow infected unless properly treated.

6.10 A major wound is chosen as an alternative to outright death, and while it can be better it can also be worse. The referee has free reign to think up whatever injury suits the situation, which will almost always include serious ability score loss. The player can choose to have their character die from their wounds later on, should they tire of playing a character whose effectiveness has been so reduced. Many injuries cause the character's condition to worsen over time (e.g. through blood loss), causing a new set of injury saves later unless properly treated.

6.11 A character taking a major wound must make a mark on their character sheet. Any character having as many such marks as their level cannot choose to take another major injury; should they fail a strength injury check they die outright.

6.12 Injuries can come from many sources that are not regular attack rolls from armed enemies. Some effects can be ruled to bypass hit points, forcing the character to make injury saves despite having HP left. Even those kinds of effects can be stopped by sacrificing HP, but the cost is by default very high; for example, a direct hit (four extra degrees of success on an attack roll) can be bypassed by paying 10 HP per level or HD of the attacker.
