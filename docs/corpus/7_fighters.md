<h2>7. Fighters</h2>

7.1 Fighters gain a bonus to all combat-related checks equal to their level. (Among the combat-related checks we count the initiative roll, all attack and defence rolls, and injury saves.)

In Maastricht '18 we only had the fighter bonus apply to initiative, attack and defense rolls.

In Dungeon Crawl '22 the rule was "all combat-related d20 rolls", which ought to include injury saves as well.

<h3>Precedents for fighter-exclusive initiations</h3>

7.2 _Tough fucker_: you roll d8 hit dice instead of d6, and you can keep your last hit point total after re-rolling instead of having to take the new value.

In Maastricht '18 the rule was slightly different, see notes for 6.4.

7.3 _Tactician_: you are keen-eyed and thoughtful as a fighter. When in a fight you get one free "tactical" each combat round. This action can be used for e.g. awareness checks to deduce the opponents' abilities or plans, or shouting orders.

7.4 _Berserk_: you are probably a barbarian of some sort. You can go berserk in a fight to gain +2 to hit in direct, savage mêlée. Berserking takes a few minutes pre-battle, or it can be triggered by getting injured mid-battle. You cannot stop berserking before the battle is over, and while berserking you will always attack the closest enemy available.

In a dire monkey fight in the Overgrown Cathedral, Fibera the berserk was allowed a DC 30 Will check to stop attacking and let an enemy escape. It was also discussed that perhaps a comrade could have made a Charisma check to try to talk her down.

In the same battle, "injured" was taken to include any HP loss.

7.5 _Weapons training_: you gain +1 to AC when using a weapon with longer reach than your opponent; you gain +1 to hit when using a lighter weapon than your opponent; you roll 1d8 instead of 1d6 damage when using a two-handed weapon; you gain +1 initiative when using a ranged weapon as long as you are unhindered.

During Maastricht '18 this was floated as a suggestion for a general rule, to differentiate between weapon types. Then, we only adopted the +1 AC for longer reach (_cf_ 5.16) meaning this initiation will stack up an additional +1 AC. Natalie's reasoning for not adopting all of these for everyone was essentially an aesthetic preference for general incompetence among non-fighters—people just generally don't fight very well, so different weapons don't do that much difference except for people who have specifically trained with them.
  
In the Overgrown Cathedral, the fighter Matei lost 1 point of initiative by stowing their sling and joining the mêlée; in other words, the bonus was taken to be persistent rather than a one-time thing at the start of combat.

7.6 _Spear training_: when using a spear, you gain +1 to hit, and +2 to AC against opponents with shorter reach than you.

7.7 _Longsword training_: when using a longsword, you gain +1 AC against opponents with shorter reach than you, and you gain one advantage die on your damage rolls.

7.8 _Bow training_: when using a bow, taking an extra action only costs you 5 initiative points, and you may do so any round in which you act before all your opponents.
