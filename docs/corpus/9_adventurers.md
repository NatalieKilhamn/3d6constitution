<h2>9. Adventurers</h2>

9.1 Adventures gain a re-roll on any d20 roll the player makes, usable as many times as the character's level per session.

<h3>Precedents for adventurer-exclusive initiations</h3>

9.2 _Circus acrobat_: you gain a bonus equal to your level to any checks that involve whole-body movement, contortionism and similar things. Only outside combat.

In Eero's original formulation, this would work in combat, but only when doing swashbuckling-style moves instead of fighting like a reasonable person—i.e. the difficulty of the check probably goes up as well. This was the written rule in Maastricht '18 but it was never used. It was changed to its current form in the initial character creation handouts made for Dungeon Crawl '22.

9.3 _Prepared_: you may account for any undetermined items in your pack, medium-sized or smaller, when setting out on an expedition. Except when in direct danger, you can make a knowledge check, DC 20, to rifle through your pack and find that you happened to bring this thing you need right now. If it's costly, retroactively pay the money you must have used to buy it back in town.

For the starting PCs of Dungeon Crawl '22, rather than paying retroactively the rule is simply that only mundane, reasonably affordable items can be found this way. It has also been established that the character can not roll again for the same situation, even if they can think of a completely different potentially useful thing.

9.4 _Keen eyes_: you gain a bonus equal to your level to any checks involving searching for hidden things and other situations where your eyesight makes a difference.

In Dungeon Crawl '22, this initiation was deemed quite weak since the bonus only applied to searching rolls. The discussion ended up splitting it in two: the original "keen eyes" would see the +lvl bonus applied to all situations where good eyesight was a major component, and the new Finder (9.5). The improved version of Keen eyes has not yet seen any use as Rönn chose to "upgrade" their version into Finder instead.

9.5 _Finder_: you can roll Wits to search a place visually just by looking around it quickly.
