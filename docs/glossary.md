<h2>Glossary</h2>
The _referee_, proposed by amendment II, can be called the _ref_ or the game master (GM). In the gaming tradition, they are also known as the dungeon master (DM), the labyrinth lord (LL), and various other terms.

The _player characters_, proposed by amendment V, can be called the _PCs_ for short.

When rolling dice, the notation _XdY_ means to roll X dice, each with Y faces (numbered 1 through Y) and add their results. XdY+Z means to add Z to the result (and similarly for other numerical operations).

The _silver pieces_ and _experience points_, both proposed by amendment IX, can be denoted _sp_ and _XP_ for short, respectively.

The evolution of rules happens partly through play and partly outside it. Play is typically organised into campaigns, where one campaign usually has some sense of unity in referees, players, setting, and when it is played. If a campaign is not otherwise named, these notes will refer to it by the name of the city that served as the main home base for the characters, if applicable, followed by the year in which it was played.

_Maastricht '18_ was the campaign that started off the 3d6 Constitution. Natalie Kilhamn was the referee; there was a core player troupe of five players, and a few guest players joined some of the sessions. It ran for nine sessions over two weeks.
